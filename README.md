# CPE400DynamicRouting

A graphical simulation of a dynamic routing network using OpenGL and our own graphics engine. Each step of the simulation, the throughput of each router's connection is slightly changed by some random amount. A decision between adding a router, removing a router, or doing nothing is also randomly made each simulation step. The user, once satisfied with the state of the network, can then visualize the shortest path between any two routers in the network. The user also has the choice between which shortest path algorithm (Dijkstra's or Bellman Ford) they would like to use. Please feel free to try it out. If the graphics program is unable to work, there is a program that runs right from the console and works just as well (though maybe not as pretty).
